# SuperLTI
LTI Lite Touch MDT Install Controller

### Why?
Because MDT and PowerShell don't mix very well.
SuperLTI allows custom install scripts written in powershell to be downloaded locally, extracted, and executed with elevated privileges durring a MDT task sequence "Install Applications" step.
